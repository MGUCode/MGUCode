- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MGUCode, French user of GitHub!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming some usefull (or not) utilities.
      I'm not a developer. I just code for fun. So be nice with me ;)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning WPF (It's a real nightmare)

In the future, maybe you will see some programs related to the industry world.
More comming soon
